**About Me**

Hello and welcome to my profile! I'm Rinalds and I have finished a level 5 diploma in Full stack web development at Code Institute! I love problem solving and have a passion for programming.

Outside of programming I also love doing photography and videography. I have a keen eye for capturing moments and telling stories through visuals.

**A Few Of My Recent Projects**
- [Artful Visions](https://github.com/rinalds98/artful-visions): A fully functioning eccomerce website.
- [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/rinalds98/expense-tracker): One of my favourite projects where I built an expense tracker using python.
- [Destination Unknown](https://github.com/rinalds98/destination-unknown): A project where I dove into using javascript.
